      <h3>About me</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My name is Victor Sarmiento. I am a Software Engineer based out of Las Vegas, Nevada. After spending some time at University, 
        I was hired on to be a Software Engieer Contractor at Silversheet Medical Credentialing. It was my first and only job being 
        recognized as a Software Engineer. I made close connections with my team and stayed with Silverhseet for about 3 years. My 
        time there was spent learning to grow and become a professional in the web development industry. I took a short sabbatical at 
        the end of 2021 to spend time with my family and friends during the holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current journey is to finish the Software Engineering Immersive Resident program at General Assembly. I've got to say that 
        the work has been very helpful in making connections to different concepts I didn't have a full grasp on. I'm looking forward 
        to finishing this journey and having an even stronger foundation for web development by the end of this. After finishing the 
        program, I hope to migrate to Washington or Texas to be a software engineer and make an impact at my future employer.
